# React Tutorial

Welcome to the React Tutorial repository! Here, you'll embark on a journey through 12 different directories, each focusing on a specific project to learn and master various aspects of React, from the basics to advanced concepts.

## Directory Structure

1. **01_counter_project**: Completed! Explore the Counter Project to understand basic React concepts. In this project, you'll learn how to create a simple counter application using React state.

2. **02_bootstrap_props**: Completed! Learn about props and Bootstrap integration in React. Props are short for "properties" and are used to pass data from one React component to another. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework for building responsive and mobile-first websites. In this project, you'll explore how to pass props between components and style your components using Bootstrap.

3. **03_bgChanger_project**: Completed! Experiment with changing backgrounds in the Background Changer Project. This project focuses on dynamic styling in React. You'll learn how to change the background color of a component based on user interactions or events.

4. **04_passwordGenerator_project**: Completed! Dive into generating passwords with the Password Generator Project. In this project, you'll explore how to generate random passwords using React state and event handling.

5. **05_currencyConvertor_project**: Completed! Discover how to convert currencies in the Theme Switcher Project. This project involves fetching data from an external API to perform currency conversion. You'll learn how to make API calls in React and update the UI based on the fetched data.

6. **06_reactRouter_project**: Completed! Navigate through different routes with React Router. React Router is a popular library for handling routing in React applications. In this project, you'll learn how to set up routes and navigate between different pages or components in a React application.

7. **08_miniContext_project**: Discuss and implement the Context API for state management. The Context API is a feature introduced in React for managing global state without the need for prop drilling. In this project, you'll explore how to create and consume context in React applications.

8. **09_themeSwitcher_project**: Completed! Further explore theme switching functionality. Building upon the Theme Switcher Project, you'll delve deeper into managing themes and implementing theme switching functionality using React state and context.

9. **10_toDoContextLocal_project**: Completed! Build a Todo Project using local context. This project focuses on creating a simple Todo application using React state and local context for state management.

10. **11_reduxToolkitTodo_project**: Completed! Enhance the Todo Project with Redux Toolkit. Redux Toolkit is a package that simplifies the process of working with Redux in React applications. In this project, you'll refactor the Todo application to use Redux Toolkit for state management.

11. **12_megaBlog_project**: Completed! Conclude with the MegaBlog Project, integrating all learned concepts. In this project, you'll combine various React concepts and features learned throughout the tutorial to build a more complex application.

## How to Use

Navigate through each directory sequentially to follow a structured learning path. Start with the basic projects and gradually progress to more advanced topics. Each project is accompanied by documentation and code examples to facilitate learning and understanding.
